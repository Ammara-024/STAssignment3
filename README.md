Project Description:
Introduction
Calculator which perform functions of Addition, Multiplication, Division, Subtraction and also take the average of three numbers. There are five functions Add(), sub(), mul(), div(), Average().
Brief Descriptions  
 Every function has two parameter of integer type except Average function has three parameters of integer type. There is ranges are define for every variable for the function, and these ranges are define as: 

Add () Function: 
Variable number: 1 – 50 
Variable number2: 51 – 100 

Sub() Function: 
Variable number: 51 – 100 
Variable number2: 1 – 50 

mul() Function: 
Variable number: 1 – 100 
Variable number2: 101 – 200 

div() Function: 
Variable number: 30 – 50 
Variable number2: 1 – 29 

Average() Function: 
Variable number1: 1 – 100 
Variable number2: 101– 200 
Variable number3: 201- 300

 In the main function, user first give a choice of what function they want to execute in the foam of number and it is then match the number with the cases in switch method when the number is match with the cases then it ask the user to enter the values and also show the ranges of the number, then it send those values to the function, after this function return the value and then it compare the value if the value is greater than zero it print the number and if it return the zero its means number is out of line.
